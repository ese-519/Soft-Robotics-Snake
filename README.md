# Soft_robotics_arm
The code is from Mbed platfowm using default mbed libraries.
The functionality is divided into 3 parts:
1. Actuate each soft actuator for some time and then release it, all by code.
2. This is manual actuation by using potentiometer to control the movelemt of each actuator. 
3. This is basic inverse kinematics control wherein each actuator can be actuated by sensing the pressure it already holds and then actuating it by  pumping air needed to make it reach a particular position.
